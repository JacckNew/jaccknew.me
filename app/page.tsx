        I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of St Andrews.

        With a backgound in finance and a passion for technology, I enjoy building creative digital solutions that bridge the gap between design and code.
        
        On this blog, I share insights from my projects, thoughts on tech, and occasional reflections on life. I hope you find something that resonates with you!`}
