# Hi, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

I've restarted personal blog more than once. But this time, I'm writing the **first** post that I actually want to keep.

I used to study **finance**. Now I'm diving into **computer science**, trying to make sense of algorithms, code, and everything in between. The transition has been a wild ride, filled with challenges and wasn't exactly smooth-but it was necessary. I realized that the urge to *build something*, to solve problems with logic and creativity, was stronger than I ever thought.

## Why this blog?

This space is partly for me, and partly for anyone who stumbles upon it.

- For me: it's a place to **slow down**, write things out, and document the process of learning and making.
- For you: maybe you'll find something helpful, relatable, or just interesting.

## What you can expect

I plan to write about:
- Projects I'm working on (even the messy ones)
- Thoughts on learning to code, as someone coming from a non-CS background just like me
- Tips and resources that have helped me along the way
- Occasional reflections or stories, because hey, life is more than just code

Maybe even some music stuff, who knows? ðŸŽµ

## Let's connect!
I'm not writing this to go viral or get followers. I'm writing this to stay honest with myself, and with the process. But if you're here reading this, thanks. Seriously. Feel free to drop a comment or just say hi.

Here's to restart. Here's to figuring things out. Here's to the journey ahead.
