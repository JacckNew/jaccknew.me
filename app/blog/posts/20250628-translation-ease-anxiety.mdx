Recently I'm suffering from anxiety. The master life has come to an end, while I don't think I've prepared for the life outside the school. What's worse, dissertation writing has spent almost all of my inner energy. Then I happened to see an answer on Zhihu, which helps me with the current situation. I'm translating it with you now.

**没有一种生活方式能彻底解决人的空虚感。**

**There is no way of life that can completely solve the feeling of emptiness in a person.**

---

自由不是答案,还会放大空虚。很多人以为,辞职自由了我就不焦虑,恋爱了我就不焦虑,赚到钱了我就不焦虑。

Freedom is not the answer; it can even amplify the emptiness. Many people think, "If I quit my job and were free, I wouldn't be anxious anymore," "If I were in a relationship, I wouldn't be anxious anymore," or "If I made enough money, I wouldn't be anxious anymore."

---

但现实常常是,每一次达成后的兴奋感都会快速消失,新的空虚却会再次升腾。你辞掉了工作,焦虑没有消失;你搬到了理想城市,却也觉得不过如此;你拥有了一段关系,却依旧有感觉自己没有被真正理解的时刻。

But the reality is often that the excitement after achieving each goal quickly fades, and a new sense of emptiness rises again. You quit your job, but the anxiety didn't disappear; you moved to your ideal city, only to find it wasn't all that special; you're in a relationship, yet you still feel misunderstood at times.

---

人的空虚感是一种常态。以兴趣为生,并不会因此热爱每一天;建立亲密关系,也不能完全抵御孤独。

A sense of emptiness is a normal state for humans. Living by your interests doesn't mean you'll love every day; building intimate relationships cannot completely ward off loneliness.

---

当生活不再有外部的强制要求时,自己和世界之间那种无所指的茫然会更加猛烈。

When life no longer has external mandatory requirements, the aimless confusion between oneself and the world becomes even more intense.

---

**所谓理想生活+，也许只是审美意义上的幻觉。**

**The so-called ideal life may just be an aesthetic illusion.**

---

社交媒体+有很多理想生活的模板:在京都喝茶写字,在意大利晾晒白衬衫,在巴黎的公寓里跳舞。

Social media is full of templates for an ideal life: drinking tea and writing in Kyoto, drying white shirts in Italy, dancing in a Parisian apartment.

---

这类场景之所以迷人,是因为它们有滤镜、有距离。

These scenes are captivating because they are filtered and distant.

---

但真当你到了这些地方,空虚也会如期而至。你发现真正的问题不是我在哪里,而是无论我在哪里,我依然不确定自己是谁。

But when you truly get to these places, the emptiness arrives as expected. You discover that the real problem isn't where I am, but that no matter where I am, I'm still not sure who I am.

---

人之所以会空虚,不是因为没有好生活,而是因为我们活着本身就要面对一个无法逃避的真相:这个世界没有为我们量身定做坚固的意义,我们只能自己去赋予它。

The reason people feel empty is not because they don't have a good life, but because we have to face an inescapable truth of existence itself: this world has not tailor-made a solid meaning for us; we can only create it for ourselves.

---

而这种赋予的过程,是一个漫长而内在的劳动。不是生活方式的选择题,而是叩问自我的开放式问题。

And this process of creation is a long and internal labor. It's not a multiple-choice question about lifestyle, but an open-ended question that requires self-interrogation.

---

过去我焦虑,是因为我以为一切不安都必须有解法。情绪来了要调节,关系坏了要修复,工作焦头烂额要立刻变好。

In the past, I was anxious because I thought every problem must have a solution. When emotions arose, they had to be managed; when a relationship soured, it had to be fixed; when work was overwhelming, it had to be improved immediately.

---

但后来发现,有些问题是没有快速的解决路径的。比如孤独,比如自我怀疑,比如对人生意义的空洞感。你越急着摆脱它,它就越萦绕在你身边。

But I later discovered that some problems have no quick fixes. For example, loneliness, self-doubt, and the feeling of emptiness about the meaning of life. The more you rush to get rid of it, the more it clings to you.

---

你越执着于成为某种人,越容易把现在的自己变得不可接受。而你越温柔地看待此刻的自己,反而越容易前行。

The more you insist on becoming a certain kind of person, the more you make your present self unacceptable. But the more gently you view yourself at this moment, the easier it is to move forward.

---

空虚不是要打败的敌人。正是因为你不是一个完全麻木的人,所以你才会察觉到这无名的空白。而每一个空虚的时刻,都在提示我们,去倾听、去看见、去深入那些没有被清楚的部分。

Emptiness is not an enemy to be defeated. It is precisely because you are not a completely numb person that you can perceive this nameless void. And every moment of emptiness is a reminder for us to listen, to see, and to delve into those parts that are not yet clear.

---

**真正停止焦虑的那一-刻,不是在得到答案之后,而是在意识到答案本身并不存在。真正的生命力,也不是存在于抵达之后,而就是那种正在挣脱的内在张力。**

**The moment you truly stop being anxious is not after you find the answer, but when you realize that the answer itself does not exist. True vitality is not found in arrival, but in the internal tension of breaking free.**

---

我不再期待生活某一天终将安稳。我也不再期待有一个人、一个事业、一个选择能彻底消除我的空虚。我开始理解,那种到达彼岸的幻想,就是我们制造焦虑的根源。

I no longer expect that one day life will finally be stable. I no longer expect that there is a person, a career, or a choice that can completely eliminate my emptiness. I began to understand that the fantasy of reaching the other shore is the very source of our anxiety.

---

世界在变,人在变,关系在变,身体在变。不安不是我的人生出了错,而是正在流动。

The world is changing, people are changing, relationships are changing, and our bodies are changing. Anxiety is not a sign that my life has gone wrong; it is a sign that it is in flux.

---

当你不再要求谁给你一份满分答卷,你才开始真正地书写你自己的故事。

When you no longer demand a perfect answer sheet from anyone, you begin to truly write your own story.

---

当你不再抗拒那种未完成、未抵达、未命名的状态,在动荡中建立起自己的重心,你就拥有了和生命同频的自由。

When you no longer resist the state of being unfinished, un-arrived, and unnamed, and instead establish your own center of gravity amidst the turbulence, you will possess a freedom that is in sync with life itself.
